# GAN_MIProject

# Generative Adversarial Network
Machine Intelligence Mini Project With Course Code: UE20CS302
We used Preprocessing And MRI Based image generation


1. Load the ipynb file into google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

2. Run First 2 sections which contains importing library and 
	creating folder with path /content/MI/images

4. Download Dataset of Images

5. Load the dataset of images into path /content/MI/images

7. Finally after executing all the cells, we get, generated images folder in /content/ directory. So all the images generated after 50 epochs is stored there. 
	• For ipynb for without preprocessing we get video of generated images in /content/MI directory . 
	• For ipynb for with preprocessing we get video of generated images in /content/MI1 directory .

8. To Run All You are supposed to delete gans_training.avi file that is generated
